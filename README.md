## Quick Start

0. Install [Stack](https://www.haskellstack.org/)

1. Fork this repository

2. Check that placeholder tests are working

    $ stack build --test

  This should print `All 2 tests passed`

3. Enable the first batch of tests in `test/Main.hs`

4. Edit the exercises in `problems/` until all tests pass

5. Repeat steps 3-4 until you've solved everything!



# Introduction

This repository contains tests for the 99 Haskell Problems.
They have been grouped by topic, as they appear on the [problems webpage](http://https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems).

The master branch contains only the tests; the solutions are on a separate branch.
